This is not an advanced JS course and is designed to fit into one day. Some important JS
concepts are not covered, but will be needed when writing JS applications that are still
important for React development:

### Topics

1. Error handling
2. HTTP fetch API
3. Parsing/formatting JSON
4. Regular expressions (for validation)
5. Promises and async/await
6. Service Workers

### Books on Modern JavaScript

## Prepare

1. Open Tests Window (top-right, icon under profile picture)
2. Make Chrome Fullscreen :)
3. If you don't like the font, change in Settings / Appearence

If you want to save your work (recommended!), you will also need to:

4. Create GitHub Account (if you don't have one)
5. Sign-in to CodeSandbox
6. Fork this repository

## CodeSandbox Keyboard Shortcuts

[https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_basic-editing]

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
Find Editor Shortcut / Action: `F1`
Save & Prettify:               `Ctrl-S`
Delete Line:                   `Ctrl-X` (no selection)
Duplicate Line Down:           `Shift+Alt-Down`
Comment:                       `Ctrl-/`
Search & Replace               `Ctrl-H`
Expand / Contract Selection:   `Shift+Alt + ->` and `Shift+Alt + <-`

## Important Note

While CodeSandbox shows changes automatically, it does not save your work automatically.
Each file needs to be saved with `Ctrl-S` and will then also be prettified.

## Where to start

Open the src/ folder to start part 1.
