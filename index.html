    <h1>Introduction to Modern JavaScript</h1>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <summary>
      This course is intended to provide a one-day <i>hands-on</i> introduction
      to modern JavaScript for existing C# and Java developers that are
      expecting to start development with React.
    </summary>

    <p>
      JavaScript is (by some measures) the most widely used language in the
      world. Over the last few years it's changed dramatically to almost not be
      the same language anymore. Like all languages JavaScript carries some
      historical baggage, in fact it has more than most. However, most of its
      flaws can be avoided and it has some really nice features too. The
      ecosystem has evolved to a place where it's really easy to get stuff done.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this course, the latest EcmaScript standards (up to ES2018) are just
      considered part of the language.
    </p>
    <p>
      This course does not try to be comprehensive. The intention is to provide
      a JavaScript introduction in a style suitable for React development. For
      example, it does not cover things that are the same or very similar in
      other C-like programming languages and it favours a declarative immutable
      style over a more imperative mutable one.
