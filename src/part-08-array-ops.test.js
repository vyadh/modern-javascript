 *
 * When developing applicatons in React, imperative-style looping constructs
 * (for, do, while) are rarely necessary. If you find yourself using explicit
 * loops, you're probably missing a trick.
 *
 * In React, you'll often find yourself creating components from an array of
 * data items by transforming them using a 'map' operation.
 *
 * If you're a Java developer, this is basically the same as using Stream
 * operations (or Vavr).
 *
 * If you're a C# developer, this is somewhat like LINQ usage. However, C#
 * differs from other languages in that it uses SQL-like terms whereas other
 * languages use terms derived from the Function Programming foundations.
 * Here is a page that describes the equivalent naming:
 * https://brunoscopelliti.com/csharp-linq-equivalents-of-javascript-array-methods
 * Summary:
 *  - map -> Select
 *  - flatMap -> SelectMany
 *  - filter -> Where
 *  - reduce -> Aggregate

// In general, we should favour this more declaritive style over imperative loops.
// There are many reasons why. See this for example: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B_AmQW7WwAE_Akt.jpg

// There are many other useful concepts from Functional Programming.
// For example, where does the term 'map-reduce' come from?
// These are covered in later sections.
